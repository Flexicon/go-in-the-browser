# Go in the Browser, using Wasm

Have you ever wanted to solve some specific problems in your web application, but JavaScript kept getting in the way?<br>
Did you ever think to yourself _"Why oh why can't I just use Go for this _surely_ very valid use-case?"_<br>
Or maybe you just heard the hubbub around WebAssembly (Wasm) and wanted to see what the big fuss was all about?

Well if you even remotely responded with an _"eh, I guess"_ to any of the above: look no further.
This repository serves as a minimal, barebones example of what it takes to get a Go program compiled down to a Wasm module,
running in your browser and interacting with JavaScript.
